My young friends, you know very well that I regularly do my ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
January, February, March, April – all these are for every family, months of most severe test!

You will witness for yourself the ensuing change.
Actually from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup and from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these 3-4 months have examinations galore.
And therefore the most effective medicine that exists for memory recall is relaxation.

It seems to become a question of life and death.
See, the exam you are going to appear at is the exam of what you have studied during this whole year.
But it is not a test of your life.
So I would like to know your views concerning the current direction of education and its future course.”
Life moves ahead depending upon the condition that whatever the sense of mission you have achieved and whatever is the sense of ambition that you nurture, whether there is any ongoing co-ordination between your sense of mission and your sense of ambition!
And therefore this burden of hankering for marks hinders us sometimes from going in the right direction.
But if something comes from outside those few things you had touched upon; a question comes which is outside the bunch of selected questions that you had prepared; you will be find yourself slipping to the rock bottom.
If you have pursuit of knowledge as your focal point, then by itself you try to acquire and attain a lot more.
It is a huge psychological battle.
He says that during exams, parents have a vital role to play.

Of course, it is quite possible that my words this morning will act as a relaxant for you.
Make headway with this Mantra.

Over the last twenty years, more than eight hundred and fifty thousand people died from disasters in the Asia-Pacific.
Seven of the top ten countries in the world in terms of number of deaths due to disasters are in the Asia-Pacific.
It was distressing to see the suffering of the affected people.
But I was also inspired by their courage, ingenuity and resolve to recover from the disaster.
In my experience, the more we relied on people’s own leadership, the better were the outcomes.
We need to support such initiative and leadership through policies and practices.
After the Indian Ocean Tsunami of 2004, the five worst affected countries brought in new laws for disaster risk management.
In a couple of days, we will observe the first International Tsunami Awareness Day.
The same goes for improvements in cyclone early warning.
In India, if we compare the impact of cyclone events in 1999 and 2013, we can see the progress we have made.
It is now recognized as a global best practice.
There are daunting challenges ahead.
If we do not manage this growth, in terms of both planning and execution, the risk of economic and human losses from disasters will be higher than ever before.
In this context, let me outline a ten-point agenda for renewing our efforts towards disaster risk reduction:
First, all development sectors must imbibe the principles of disaster risk management.
Over the next couple of decades, most of the new infrastructure in the world will come up in our region.
We need to ensure that we build it to best available standards of disaster safety.
India will work with other partner countries and stakeholders to build a coalition or centre for promoting disaster resilient infrastructure in the region.
Currently, in most countries of the region, penetration of insurance is limited to only middle and upper-middle income groups.
The Jan Dhan Yojana has brought millions of people into the banking system.
The Suraksha Bima Yojana provides risk insurance to millions who need it the most.
They also have unique strengths and insights.
Fourth, invest in risk mapping globally.
For mapping risks related to hazards such as earthquakes we have widely accepted standards and parameters.
As part of this network, different universities could specialize in multi-disciplinary research on disaster issues most relevant to them.
Social media is transforming disaster response.
It is helping response agencies in quickly organizing themselves, and enabling citizens to connect more easily with authorities.
In disaster after disaster, affected people are using social media to help each other.
Specific actions have to be designed and implemented locally.
For example, if a local fire service visits one school in its area every week, it would sensitize thousands of children over a period of one year.
And finally, bring about greater cohesion in international response to disasters.
In the aftermath of a disaster, disaster responders pour in from all over the world.
In our effort to build disaster resilience, we stand shoulder to shoulder with all the nations of the region.
Regional and International Cooperation has an important role in providing an added push to our efforts.
Last year in November, India organized the first-ever South Asian Annual Disaster Management Exercise.
In the spirit of regional cooperation, India will soon launch the South Asia Satellite.
As we implement the Sendai Framework, we would welcome new opportunities for regional and international collaboration.
The PM added, “The Government is constantly working to create a conducive environment for business in the country.
It is because of such efforts that we have improved significantly on the Ease of Doing Business rankings from 142 to 77”.

We are clearing loans up to Rs one crore in 59 minutes”.
I thanked all the parties on that day.
When all parties work together in the larger nation interest, positive outcomes and results emerge.
Besides, the government’s thinking would also be reflected.
I expect a good, healthy debate with excellent contribution from all the political parties..
I am happy to be a part of this august gathering of global leaders and decision makers of the food processing sector.
India is also the world’s biggest milk producer.
Our trade synergies with Europe and South East Asia through the Spice Route are well known.
Food processing is a way of life in India.
India is also rapidly progressing on the Global Innovation Index, Global Logistics Index and Global Competitiveness Index.
Starting a new business in India is now easier than ever before.
Procedures for obtaining clearances from various agencies have been simplified.
I now turn specifically, to food processing.
The Government has undertaken a range of transformational initiatives.
India is now the most preferred investment destination in this sector.
A single-window facilitation cell provides handholding for foreign investors.
Such is the scale of opportunity that is waiting to be tapped.

Through these food parks, we aim to link agro-processing clusters with key production centres.
To improve last mile delivery, we are improving governance, by increasing access to digital technology.
Honey is nature’s gift to mankind.
Currently, we rank sixth in the production and export of honey.
India is now ripe, for a sweet revolution.
India contributes over six per cent of global fish production.
We are the world’s second largest exporter of shrimps.
India exports fish and fisheries products to about 95 countries.
We aim to make a big leap in the ocean economy through the blue revolution.
They can also withstand adverse agro-climatic conditions.
They can be called “nutrition rich and climate smart” crops.
These are some questions that I wish to leave you with.
I am confident that World Food India will help us take some concrete steps in this direction.

Friends, till recently Indian importers had to go abroad to view and purchase rough diamonds.

Earlier only eighty to ninety big merchants used to get access to global rough diamonds by travelling to Belgium, Africa and Israel.
Now, about three thousand small and medium merchants have this privilege through the new Special Notified Zone.
Skill India aims to ensure that new entrants to the work force have the necessary skills to contribute to the economy of the 21st century.
The gems and jewellery sector employs 4.6 million people.
Out of this, one million people are in the diamonds industry alone.
Thus the gems and jewellery sector is a prime example of the potential of ‘Make In India’ and Skill India.
Today, we have with us Ministers from several African countries.
This does not do justice to our rich experience and abundant design talent.
Even hair dressers change hair style fashions of their clients.
We live in an era where diamonds are used in spectacles, watches and pens.
There was a time in the past where some products from India had achieved a global reputation.
I hope the industry is in constant touch with them.
What goals is the gems and jewellery industry setting for itself by that date?
We can certainly consider them if they are in the interest of our country.
