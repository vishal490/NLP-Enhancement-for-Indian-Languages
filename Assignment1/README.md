                  Trained model:- contains Trained model ( unigram and BPE both) for diffrent vocab sizes
4.231110030_Linguistics.ipynb :- This is the jupyter notebook containing solution of all Questions mentionde in Assignment.



## How To RUN

The following steps can be used to run the code

1. open 231110030_Linguistics.ipynb in jupyter lab
2. first cell is useful if you are using google colab, in that case you have to make that cell as code cell  and run
3.next cell contains installation command  for all required libraries and modules
4. all furthur instructions are in jupyter notebook for each cell
